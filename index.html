        <h1>I find your lack of faith disturbing.</h1>
        <p>I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.</p>
        <p>I can't get involved! I've got work to do! <strong> It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.</strong> <em> It's such a long way from here.</em> I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.</p>
        <h2>Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me believe there's one all-powerful Force controlling everything. There's no mystical energy field that controls my destiny. It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.</h2>
        <p>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan-- The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!</li><li>I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--</li><li>The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.</h3>
        <p>Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>You don't believe in the Force, do you?</li><li>Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</li><li>What?!</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. You mean it controls your actions?</p>
        <p>As you wish. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. He is here. I find your lack of faith disturbing.</p>
        <p>Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I'm trying not to, kid. What?! Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?</p>
        <p>Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?</p>
        <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. You mean it controls your actions? Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. Don't underestimate the Force.</p>
        <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
        <p>Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money.</p>
        <p>He is here. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going. Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.</p>
        <p>All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more likeâ€¦suicide.</p>
        <p>But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? You don't believe in the Force, do you? Red Five standing by. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.</p>
        <p>In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. I find your lack of faith disturbing. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.</p>
